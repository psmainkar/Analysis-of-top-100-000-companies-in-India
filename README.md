# End-to-end-data-analysis-project-
This project entails an end-to-end data analysis process, encompassing web scraping, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization of a dataset featuring the top 100,000 companies in India, ranked by net salaries according to ambitionbox.com.

The web scraping aspect was executed using the Beautiful Soup library. Subsequently, data cleaning procedures were implemented leveraging the pandas and numpy libraries in Python.

Following the cleaning process, an in-depth exploratory data analysis was carried out to extract meaningful insights from the dataset. This involved statistical analysis, pattern recognition, and data summarization techniques.

For the final stage of the project, dashboards were created utilizing PowerBI to visually present the analyzed data. These dashboards serve as a comprehensive and interactive representation of the key findings, allowing stakeholders to gain valuable insights into the top companies in India based on net salaries.
